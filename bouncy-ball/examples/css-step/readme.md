# CSS Step Animations

A *CSS Step Animation* is a technique which uses the CSS `steps()` function to rapidly step through images in a sprite sheet, giving the appearance of motion.

This technique uses the CSS Animations API but it's different in that it only animates the background-position property, relying on the contents of the background-image to provide the illusion of motion. In this way, the approach has similarities to animated gifs and other "flipbook-style" approaches.
