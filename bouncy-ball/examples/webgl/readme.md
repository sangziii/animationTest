# WebGL

WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics without the use of plug-ins. WebGL is integrated completely into all the web standards of the browser allowing GPU accelerated usage of physics and image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas.

WebGL programs consist of control code written in JavaScript and shader code that is written in OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), a language similar to C or C++, and is executed on a computer's graphics processing unit (GPU). WebGL is designed and maintained by the non-profit Khronos Group.
