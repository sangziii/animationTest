# SMIL (SVG)

SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language), is a technology for declarative, SVG-native animation.

## Support and Deprecation

[Browser support for SMIL is limited](http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-smil), and the current implementations vary widely from browser to browser. For example, performance can vary greatly, depending on the browser and the technique used to embed it.

In some browsers, like Chrome, SMIL is deprecated and using it will result in a warning in the console. Support is expected to be dropped in some future version.

Other browsers, like Internet Explorer, currently have no plans to implement it.
