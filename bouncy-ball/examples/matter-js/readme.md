# Matter.js

Matter.js is a JavaScript 2D rigid body physics engine for the web. Matter.js can be used to build  anything from physics-based demos to 2-dimensional games.

Like other physics engines, it allows you to define a "World" and the physical laws that exist in it like gravity, air friction, and constraints. Each of the objects in this world have their own set of physical properties, like size, mass, and elasticity. The resulting behaviors are the physics-based interactions between these objects and their environment. Matter.js also supports user interactions via the mouse, keyboard, and touch devices.

Matter.js uses HTML5's canvas for rendering and supports a number of drawing options including wireframe, solid colors, and sprites.
