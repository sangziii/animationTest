# Animated GIF

A GIF (which stands for Graphics Interchange Format) is an image using the GIF bitmap image format. [All modern web-browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Image_format_support) can display GIFs. The format typically supports a maximum of 256 colors. Gif images use a file extension of `.gif`.

GIFs support animation, which works by displaying a series of individual image frames in rapid succession. Animated GIFs support looping and configurable frame rates.

GIFs don't compress as well as other comparable formats (like PNGs for still images and MP4/WebM for video). This can lead to large file sizes for animated gifs that have a lot of frames or lots of detail in each frame.

Other animated image formats exist, like [WebP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) and [APNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APNG). These offer improvements to GIF, like supporting more colors, improving transparency, and reducing file-size. These newer formats are [not](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webp) [supported](http://caniuse.com/#feat=apng) yet in all major browsers, but can be selectively served to supporting browsers via the picture element (as shown in this example).
