# CSS Animations

CSS Animations (introduced in CSS3) use declarative settings and `@keyframe` assignments to animate the values of CSS properties. No external libraries are required for supported browsers.

In this demo, we set keyframes at the top and bottom positions and use cubic-bezier easings to transition between them.
