# D3
D3 (which stands for 'data-driven documents') is a library for manipulating web documents with data. It allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document.

D3 is often used for custom data-visualization, because of its flexibility. Unlike charting libraries with pre-built graphics, it outputs to lower-level standard web formats like HTML, SVG, or Canvas.

This bouncy-ball animation isn't data driven, but it demonstrates D3's transformation API on an SVG element.
