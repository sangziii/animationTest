# Contribute

Hey! You're thinking about contributing? That's awesome! You're awesome.

Here's a few things you should know before you submit your PR:

1. Bouncy Ball is a curation, not a collection. Not every technique makes sense in this format. For example, submissions using immature libraries, unstable APIs, or slight variations on existing techniques probably wouldn't be accepted.
2. New animation code should not require a build/compile step. For example, you'll want to use CSS instead of SCSS and browser-compatible ES5 instead of transpiled ES6.
3. Write concise, clean code. For style recommendations, check out [AirBnB's ES5 Javscript Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/b4d8543f120ba761ae7f39caf850c1e4efdc2727/es5).
4. Any new animation should work on the demo page and be visually indistinguishable from existing animations (except for the color of the ball).
5. Please test your animation across modern browsers. If some browsers don't support the animation, ensure the incompatibilty message is displayed.
6. The browser compatibility requirement for the bouncy-ball site itself is modern browsers (IE9+, and latest: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari).

When in doubt on how to organize your example, start by copying the `examples/template` folder and using it as a base. You can look at the structure of existing examples for reference.

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the project down to your computer.
2. From the project folder, run `yarn install` in your terminal ([install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), if you don't already have it installed).
3. Start a local static server with `yarn start` in your terminal and visit the URL given by the output to see the site.
   - For local server configurations see [server.md](/server.md)
4. Make file changes.
5. Run `yarn run build` to build the assets, and refresh your browser to see the changes.
